Title: Optimal Occupancy Strategy for Enhanced Airline Profitability:  SQL Data Analysis Project

•Description:

This comprehensive data analysis project utilizes SQL queries to extract valuable insights from a fictional airline's dataset. The primary objective is to identify opportunities for increasing the occupancy rate on low-performing flights, ultimately aiming to boost the airline's profitability.

•Steps:


1. Importing Libraries
   
The project begins by importing essential libraries such as sqlite3 for database connection, pandas for data manipulation, and matplotlib.pyplot along with seaborn for effective data visualization.
The warnings library is employed to filter out potential warning messages during the analysis.

2. Database Connection

A connection is established with a SQLite database named 'travel.sqlite,' and a cursor object is created to interact with the database. 
The project retrieves a list of table names present in the database for reference in subsequent steps.


3. Data Exploration

This critical step involves exploring the dataset to understand its structure and potential challenges. 
Data from each table is read into separate pandas DataFrames, and the first few rows of each DataFrame are displayed. This initial exploration sets the foundation for informed decisions on data cleaning and further analysis.

4. Data Cleaning

Understanding data completeness is crucial for reliability. 
The project iterates through each table, reading the data into DataFrames and printing the count of missing values for each column. This information guides decisions on data imputation or cleansing strategies.


5. Basic Analysis

Basic SQL queries are conducted to answer specific questions, such as identifying planes with more than 100 seats and exploring ticket booking trends over time using time-series plots. 
Visualizations enhance the interpretation of patterns and trends.


6. Analyzing Occupancy Rate

This step involves complex SQL queries for calculating average charges, total revenue per year, average revenue per ticket, and average occupancy per aircraft. 
Visualizations using pandas and Seaborn enhance the interpretability of the results.


7. Increasing Occupancy Rate

The project simulates the impact of a 10% increase in the occupancy rate for each aircraft and calculates the potential rise in total annual turnover by comparing original and increased occupancy rates.


Summary:

This data analysis project aims to optimize the occupancy rate for low-performing flights, ultimately maximizing the airline's profitability. 
From comprehensive data exploration to insightful SQL queries and visualizations, each step contributes to a holistic understanding of the dataset and strategic decision-making.
